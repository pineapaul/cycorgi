# MITRE ATTACK API Security Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements implemented to address the security risk identified in the MITRE ATTACK API integration. The original implementation was fetching data directly from GitHub raw content without proper validation, which could pose security risks.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. **Insecure External Data Fetching**
- **Before**: Direct HTTP requests to GitHub raw content URLs
- **After**: Secure API calls to official MITRE ATTACK endpoints with proper validation

### 2. **Lack of Input Validation**
- **Before**: No validation of fetched data structure or content
- **After**: Comprehensive validation of STIX data structure, content types, and response sizes

### 3. **No Content Sanitization**
- **Before**: Raw data passed through without sanitization
- **After**: XSS prevention through string sanitization and content filtering

### 4. **Missing Security Controls**
- **Before**: No rate limiting, timeout controls, or security logging
- **After**: Rate limiting, request timeouts, and comprehensive security event logging

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Secure Configuration Management**
- Centralised security configuration in `lib/mitre-security-config.ts`
- Environment-specific security settings
- Type-safe configuration access

### 2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- STIX data structure validation
- Content type validation (JSON only)
- Response size limits (10MB max)
- String length limits and sanitization
- XSS prevention through script tag removal

### 3. **Request Security**
- Request timeouts (10s production, 5s development)
- Rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
- Secure fetch utility with built-in validation
- User-Agent identification

### 4. **Caching & Fallback**
- 24-hour data caching to reduce external API calls
- Grace period for expired cache during API failures
- Trusted fallback to sample data when external API fails
- Memory cache with production considerations

### 5. **Security Monitoring**
- Security event logging for all operations
- Failed request tracking
- Invalid data detection and logging
- Rate limit violation monitoring

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `lib/mitre-security-config.ts` - Security configuration
- `lib/mitre-security-utils.ts` - Security utilities and validation
- `MITRE_SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/api/mitre-attack/techniques/route.ts` - Main API route with security improvements

## Configuration Options

### Cache Settings
```typescript
cache: {
  duration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  gracePeriod: 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 48 hours
  enableMemoryCache: true
}
```

### Validation Limits
```typescript
validation: {
  maxResponseSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
  maxObjects: 10000,
  maxTechniques: 1000,
  maxNameLength: 200,
  maxDescriptionLength: 2000
}
```

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
rateLimit: {
  maxRequestsPerMinute: 60,
  windowMs: 60 * 1000
}
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and sanitization
2. **Fail Securely**: Graceful fallback to trusted data when external sources fail
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external data
4. **Output Sanitization**: XSS prevention through content filtering
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events
7. **Configuration Management**: Centralised, auditable security settings

## Production Considerations

### Caching
- Current implementation uses in-memory caching
- For production, consider Redis or similar distributed caching
- Implement cache invalidation strategies

### Monitoring
- Security events are currently logged to console
- In production, integrate with security monitoring systems
- Set up alerts for security violations

### Rate Limiting
- Current implementation is per-instance
- For production, consider distributed rate limiting
- Implement IP-based rate limiting if needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**
   - Test with malformed STIX data
   - Verify XSS prevention
   - Test rate limiting functionality
   - Validate timeout handling

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large response sizes
   - Verify caching effectiveness
   - Test fallback mechanisms

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with MITRE API availability
   - Verify fallback to sample data
   - Test error handling scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Integration with SIEM systems
   - Real-time security alerts
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Redis integration for distributed caching
   - Cache warming strategies
   - Intelligent cache invalidation

3. **Additional Security Controls**
   - IP whitelisting for MITRE API
   - Certificate pinning for HTTPS
   - Advanced threat detection

## Compliance

These improvements align with:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Secure coding best practices
- Data validation and sanitization requirements
- API security standards

## Conclusion

The security improvements transform the MITRE ATTACK API integration from a potentially risky external data fetching system to a secure, validated, and monitored API endpoint. The implementation follows security best practices and provides multiple layers of protection against various attack vectors.
